     <h2>Overview</h2>
	  <p>
	    The purpose of this workshop has historically been to provide a forum for scientists in both the United States and Japan to present and discuss recent results in compact toroidal (CT) plasma confinement. This year, the topical scope of the workshop will expand to include the so-called "Alternative" or "Innovative" confinement concepts such as pinches, mirrors, magneto-inertial confinement, electrostatic confinement, etc. As private investment in fusion energy research has continued to rise, the future of the community is in flux. However, it remains vitally important for researchers to remain up to date on recent developments, recruit students and staff, and engage in active discussion to stimulate the generation of new ideas and approaches.

	 <h2>Dates</h2>
     <p>This will be a fully-online workshop held March 8 - 9 (USA) and March 9 - 10 (Japan)</p>
